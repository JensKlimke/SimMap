# SimMap

A framework for maps for traffic simulations

## Usage

See LibraryTest code. This library is the interface to the framework. However, the you can also use the server lib or odradapter lib to have more control of the map. 

Attention: You have to run some tests from the project folder, because the map files are added relative to this path.
